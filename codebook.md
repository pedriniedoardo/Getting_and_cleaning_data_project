## Intro

this is the codebook for the dataset `tidy_df.txt`

for more information about the repository check the `README.md`.


## Data

`tidy_df.txt` is a space delimited table of 180 row (entry) and 81 columns (variables).

`tidy_df.txt` is a summary containing the averages of the variables from index 3 to index 81 per unique Subject~Activity.


## Variables

- `Subject`

	Subject identifier, integer, ranges from 1 to 30.

- `Activity`

	Activity identifier, char string with 6 possible values: 
	- `WALKING`: subject was walking
	- `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`: subject was walking upstairs
	- `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`: subject was walking downstairs
	- `SITTING`: subject was sitting
	- `STANDING`: subject was standing
	- `LAYING`: subject was laying
